# This list configures which sites are allowed to be opened outside of Windows
# Defender Application Guard. Adding a site here does not immediately allow
# access to it. You must first import it using Apply-WDAGWhitelist.ps1.
#
# List one site per line. Sites can be prefixed with some modifiers to change
# how they behave:
#  . = allow all sub-domains
#  @ = allow access only outside of Application Guard
