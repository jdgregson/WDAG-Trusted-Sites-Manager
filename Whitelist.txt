# This is a sample trusted sites list used by WDAG Trusted Sites Manager.
#
# This list configures which sites are allowed to be opened outside of Windows
# Defender Application Guard. Adding a site here does not immediately allow
# access to it. You must first import it using Manage-WdagTrustedSites.ps1.
#
# List one site per line. Sites can be prefixed with some modifiers to change
# how they behave:
#  . = allow all sub-domains
#  @ = allow access only outside of Application Guard

# Corporate sites - these cannot be accessed from inside WDAG.
@.mycompany.com
@mycompany.sharepoint.com
@.slack.com

# Trusted sites - these can be accessed inside or outside of WDAG.
